li_media_upload(author, media)
}
\arguments{
\item{author}{A character string representing
the LinkedIn profile or organization
ID in the format \code{urn:li:person:XXXX} or
\code{urn:li:organization:XXXX}. This identifies
the owner of the media being uploaded.}

\item{media}{A character string representing
the file path to the media (e.g., an
image file) to be uploaded.}
}
\value{

LinkedIn image URL that can be used

}
\description{
The \code{li_media_upload} function uploads a media
file (e.g., an image) to LinkedIn
for use in posts or other content. It first
initializes the upload process with
LinkedInâ€™s API, then uploads the media file to
the provided upload URL.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Initializes the media upload by sending a
request to the LinkedIn API.
\item Extracts the \code{uploadUrl} from the
response, which specifies where to upload
the media file.
\item Uploads the media file to the \code{uploadUrl}.
\item Returns the image URL generated by
LinkedIn for referencing the uploaded file.
}

The \code{li_req()} function, assumed to create an
authenticated LinkedIn API request,
must be available in the calling environment.
}
